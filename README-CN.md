The repository manages the code and some of the utilities related to our project VSNLite

[^Lightweight Segmentation Neural Networks for Measuring Vickers Hardness]: 

.

Compared to previous methods, the proposed networks achieve a reduction of 35.2 times in terms of computational cost with up to 38 times fewer parameters, while maintaining the same level of segmentation accuracy.
